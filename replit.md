# Bro Code Learning Projects

## Overview
This is a collection of simple JavaScript learning projects imported from GitHub. The project contains two interactive web applications demonstrating fundamental JavaScript concepts:

1. **Counter Program** - A counter application with increase, decrease, and reset functionality
2. **User Input** - A form that demonstrates DOM manipulation and user input handling

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript
- **Server**: Python 3.11 HTTP server
- **Port**: 5000 (configured for Replit environment)

## Setup Details
- The project uses a simple Python HTTP server to serve static files
- Server is configured with cache control headers to ensure changes are visible immediately
- Host is set to 0.0.0.0 to work with Replit's proxy system
- No build process or dependencies required

## Recent Changes (October 21, 2025)
- ✅ Imported from GitHub
- ✅ Added missing JavaScript logic for Counter Program
- ✅ Created landing page (index.html) to navigate between projects
- ✅ Set up Python HTTP server with proper cache headers
- ✅ Configured workflow to run on port 5000
- ✅ Added .gitignore entries for Python

## How to Run
The server automatically starts via the configured workflow. Visit the main page to access both learning projects.
